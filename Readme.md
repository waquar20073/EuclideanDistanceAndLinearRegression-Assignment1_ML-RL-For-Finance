# Question 1

**Write a program to calculate Euclidean Distance.** **Instruction:** Euclidean Distance Calculation. In this question you will compute Euclidean distance between elements in n-dimensional space. Each coordinate of a point in n-dimensional space is sampled from Uniform distribution. Use Numpy library.







# Question 2

**Write a program to implement Linear Regression.**
**Instruction:** In this question you will implement linear regression model using three Python packages:
scikit-learn, numpy, and tensorflow.
The grader expects the first value to be the y_intercept (a) and then the rest of the coefficients.
